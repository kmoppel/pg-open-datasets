* Move DROP_INPUT_FILES_AFTER_IMPORT to main loop from implementations
* Add a flag to re-init a fresh PG instance for each dataset
  - this would allow to measure more precisely WAL generation with different settings etc
* Add schema diagrams to datasets where possible ?
* A script to reset all vars
